## Introduction

Cellular Automata is a fun passion project I did because I wanted practice using the d3.js library. Data visualization has always been an interest of mine and so I wanted to work on a project that would help further expand on this skill. 
</br>
</br>
The concept of Cellular Automata revolves around the idea that complex systems in life, organic or inorganic, can be modeled through microinteractions between smaller individual pieces. Depending on the system being modeled, there exists **rules** which govern the interactions between these individual pieces of the system that, in the end, affect the system on a macro level. 
</br>
</br>
In this project, I model 3 different systems: traffic, forest fires, and urban growth. 

## Technologies

**Frontend** <br/> 
This project was done entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and the d3.js library.

## Highlights
* **Traffic Model**
