                        To first understand what <span style="font-style:italic">cellular automata</span> is, we have to understand what exactly

                        A complex system is defined as a system comprised of many components that interact with their local, surrounding neighbors based on a given 
                        subset of rules. When these smaller components interact with each other on this scale, a different behavior or pattern emerges from the 
                        system as a whole. As a result of these constant micro-interactions, complex systems can be thought as greater than the sum of its parts.

                        Why might this be relevant?

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Complex systems exist in all walks of life and models can be created in order to mimic these complex systems found in real life. 
                        A complex system can be as small as a cell or, ultimately, as large as our universe, itself. It can be as natural as the process of how snowflakes 
                        are formed or as man-made as the field of complexity economics, which uses computational rather than mathematical analysis to explore how economic structures are formed and reformed.

                        Researchers study these complex systems and, with the
                        help of modern technology, model them in order to get a better understanding of how they operate and make informed decisions on solutions to problems 
                        that stem from some of these complex systems.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Cellular automaton (abbrev. CA) is a type of model that can be used to describe specific complex systems.  
                        These systems consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off. 
                        The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined 
                        relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule
                        that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the
                        cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. These rules that govern the state of cells are typically the same
                        for each cell and are applied to the whole grid simultaneously, although exceptions to this are dependent 
                        on the system modeled. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        As simple as this sounds, CA has the ability to create some very complex, unpredictable patterns in 1, 2 or sometimes even
                        3 dimensions, depending on the type of system modeled.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        In the case of a 1-dimensional CA, such as the one seen in the figure above, each row will represent a different state in time. 
                        The very first row represents the initial state of the CA system and the subsequent rows under it will each represent one step 
                        forward in time. Each new cell that is generated in a subsequent row will be based on the cell directly
                        above it and the above cell's two neighbors to the left and right of it.

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Clicking the figure above will generate a random, applicable CA rule. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        1-D CA models are also called <span style="font-style: italic;">elementary cellular automaton</span>, as it's the most basic way
                        to depict a CA model. In an elementary CA model, the rules that dictate how new cells are formed are based on a binary, more on this later.
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Previously we talked about how each cell has a finite number of "states" and that these states are mutable as time progresses.
                        These states can be any values, string or integer, as long as these different values for each state affect how 
                        each cell is graphically represented in the model and possibly how they interact with their neighbors. 
                        For elementary CA models, the state of each cell or square on the board will either be "1" for <span style="font-weight: 700;">on</span> or "0", <span style="font-weight: 700;">off</span>.
                        Black squares represent a cell being "on" or "1".

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Since any given cell in an elementary CA model will only have 2 neighbors, its left and right neighbor, there exists a total of 
                        8 unique arrangements for how a grouping of 3 cells can be represented on the board: 111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001, 000. In base 10 form, these 
                        binary groupings translate to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, respectively. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        From there, a "rule" is applied which then generates how the next row in the sequence will look based on the input.
                        These rules applied will take the input, the grouping, and return an output -- which, for elementary CA models, will either be a 0 or a 1 
                        for the cell directly below the middle cell in the grouping.
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Below is the rule set for "Rule 90", which is the default rule displayed for the figure above and the one applied to the figure below the rule set. Again, the black squares denote a 1 and the 
                        white squares denote a 0. The top row of each T-block corresponds to the type of 3-cell groupings, the input of the rule set, while the 
                        bottom row of each T-block is the output for that specific grouping. Starting on the right side of the below figure, you'll see the output generated if all 3 cells in a grouping are 0's ("000").
                        
                    </p>

                    <img src="./images/rule90.png" alt="rule90" style="width: 450px;"/>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        You're probably now wondering how these "rules" are formed? Well, if you convert 01011010 (the output of this rule set) in base 10, you'll get the number 90. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        As a result of this logic, there are a total of 256 different rule sets that are applicable to elementary CA. In other words, there are 
                        a total of 256 different ways you could arrange this 8 character long output consisting 0's and 1's. 00000000 would correspond to Rule 0 (generates nothing, surprise!), 
                        while 11111111 would correspond to Rule 255 (the last rule possible, as 256 in binary requires one more bit to be represented).

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        The order of how each group input is fed into which output corresponds to the positional value of the grouping. If you recall previously, each grouping 
                        can be translated into a base 10 form consisting of the numbers from 0 to 7. The 0th grouping will correlate to the right-most output and the 7th grouping
                        will correlate to the left-most output of each rule. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Of these 256 rules, some rules develop interesting patterns only when they start off from a single cell and other rules develop patterns from randomness. 
                        The figure below generates a random initial sequence on every click along with a random rule applied to it.

                        What makes elementary CA so interesting is how much depth there is to something so simple. While its practical applications aren't as 
                        realized as 2-d CA models, 1-d elementary CA has become an entire field of study within CA due to the theoretical implications in math and computer science
                        that some rules exhibit. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Rule 90 creates a fractal structure called a <a id="edge-of-chaos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle" target="_blank">Sierpiński triangle</a>. Given 
                        a much higher resolution, this triangular pattern is infinitely repeated.  
                        Other rules like Rule 110 have been proven to be <a id="edge-of-chaos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank">Turing complete</a>. This essentially implies that,
                        given unlimited memory and time, any calculation or computer program can be simulated using this automaton provided that you give it the correct initial input.

                    </br>

                        Beyond the theory are some practical applications. Take for instance, Rule 184 or the "Traffic Rule". Rule 184 solves what cellular automata scientists call
                        the "Majority Problem". The Majority Problem in cellular automata is the problem of finding a 1-d CA rule that exhibits the behavior
                        of "majority voting", wherein given a configuration of a two-state CA model with i + j cells total, i of which are in the "0" state and j
                        of which are in the "1" state, a correct solution to the voting problem must eventually set all cells to "0" if i > j
                        and must eventually set all cells to "1" if i < j. The desired eventual state is unspecified if i = j.

                        clears up. Traffic jams are seen as clusters of black with no spaces in between them and will occur when 
                        a car is directly next to another car.

                        The model generated an initial row of 25% density, meaning that cars will randomly fill 25% of the empty spaces on the initial row.
                        From this initial preset, you can see that cars generally flow freely along the road and traffic jams clear up pretty quickly.

                        The graph above will show the number of cars visible within the frame at each current generation. The count of cars are found on the 
                        y-axis while the time generation is on the x-axis. From the figure, we can see that the count of cars is trending toward 0 as time increases. 
                        This is an example of a solution to the majority rule as the initial traffic conditions had the majority of cell states being "0", or empty space.

                        In the example above, you'll see an initial traffic density of 50%. Traffic generally clears up depending on the initial, random arrangement of cars. However, as you
                        click through, you'll see that there are also some situations wherein you'll see that traffic hits a tipping point and gets backed up.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        In the situation where you'll have 75% of cars fill the initial condition at random, traffic will almost always get
                        backed up. There are, however, rare instances where the Majority Rule will fail to pass and traffic clears up, but this isn't as 
                        frequent as a 50% initial density model.

                        In the figure above, you'll see how most graphs trend toward an increasing amount of cars being congested on the road. 
                        
                    </br> 
                    </br> 

                        Rule 184 is an interesting rule as it implicates that from a simple ruleset, a system is able to identify the majority state based on a non-recorded count of 
                        the state of each of the single cell's neighbors. At no point are cells given the total count of either states, and yet, it generally closes in on the 
                        majority.
