                        To first understand what <span style="font-style:italic">cellular automata</span> is, we have to understand what exactly

                        A complex system is defined as a system comprised of many components that interact with their local, surrounding neighbors based on a given 
                        subset of rules. When these smaller components interact with each other on this scale, a different behavior or pattern emerges from the 
                        system as a whole. As a result of these constant micro-interactions, complex systems can be thought as greater than the sum of its parts.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Why might this be relevant?

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Complex systems exist in all walks of life and models can be created in order to mimic these complex systems found in real life. 
                        A complex system can be as small as a cell or as large as our universe. It can be as natural as the process of how snowflakes 
                        are formed or as man-made as the field of complexity economics.

                    </br>
                        Researchers study these complex systems and, with the
                        help of modern technology, model them in order to get a better understanding of how they operate in order to make better decisions on problems
                        stemming from these complex systems.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Cellular automaton (abbrev. CA) is a type of model that can be used to describe specific complex systems.  
                        These systems consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as "on" and "off". 
                        This grid can be in any finite number of dimensions, but is usually either 1-d or 2-d. A set of cells, called a neighborhood, is defined 
                        relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        A new generation is created (advancing t by 1) according to some fixed rule,
                        which defines the new state of each cell relative to its current state and that of cells in its neighborhood. These rules that govern cell states are typically the same
                        for each cell and applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        As simple as this sounds, CA has the ability to create some very complex, unpredictable patterns.

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        In the case of a 1-d CA, such as the one seen in the figure above, each row can be seen as a different state in time. 
                        The very first row is the initial state of the CA system and the subsequent rows under it will each be seen as one step 
                        forward in time. Each new cell that is generated in a subsequent row will be based on the cell directly
                        above it and the above cell's two neighbors to the left and right of it.

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Clicking the figure above will generate a random CA rule. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        1-dimensional CA models are also called <span style="font-style: italic;">elementary cellular automaton</span>, as it's the most basic way
                        to depict a CA model. In an elementary CA model, the rules that dictate how new cells are formed are based on a binary structure, more on this later.
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Previously we talked about how each cell has a finite number of "states" and that these states are mutable as time progresses.
                        These states can be any values, string or integer, as long as these different values affect how 
                        each cell is graphically presented in the model and possibly how they interact with their neighbors. 
                        For elementary CA models, the state of each cell or square on the board will either be "1" for <span style="font-weight: 700;">on</span> or "0", <span style="font-weight: 700;">off</span>.
                        Black squares represent a cell being "on" or "1".

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Since any given cell in an elementary CA model will only have 2 neighbors, its left and right neighbor, there exists a total of 
                        8 unique configurations for how a grouping of 3 cells can be arranged on the board: 111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001, 000. In base 10 form, these 
                        binary groupings translate to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, respectively. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        From there, a "rule" is applied which then generates how the next row in the sequence will look based on the input.
                        These rules applied will take the input, the grouping, and return an output -- which, for elementary CA models, will either be a 0 or a 1 
                        for the cell directly below the middle cell in the grouping.
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Below is the rule set for "Rule 90", which is the default rule displayed for the figure above and the one applied to the figure below the rule set. Again, the black squares denote a 1 and the 
                        white squares denote a 0. The top row of each T-block corresponds to the type of 3-cell groupings, the input of the rule set, while the 
                        bottom row of each T-block is the output for that specific grouping. Starting on the right side of the below figure, you'll see the output generated if all 3 cells in a grouping are 0's ("000").
                        
                    </p>

                    <img src="./images/rule90.png" alt="rule90" style="width: 450px;"/>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        You're probably wondering how these "rules" are formed. Well, if you convert 01011010 (the output of this rule set) in base 10, you'll get the number 90. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        As a result of this logic, there are a total of 256 different rule sets that are applicable to elementary CA. In other words, there are 
                        a total of 256 different ways you could arrange this 8 character long output consisting of 0's and 1's. 00000000 would correspond to Rule 0 (generates nothing, surprise!), 
                        while 11111111 would correspond to Rule 255 (the last rule possible, as 256 in binary requires one more bit).

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        The order of how each group input is fed into which output corresponds to the positional value of the grouping. If you recall previously, each grouping 
                        can be translated into a base 10 form consisting of the numbers from 0 to 7. The 0th grouping will correlate to the right-most output and the 7th grouping
                        will correlate to the left-most output of each rule. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Of these 256 rules, some rules develop interesting patterns only when they start off from a single cell and other rules develop patterns from randomness. 
                        The figure below generates a random initial sequence on every click along with a random rule applied to it.

                        What makes elementary CA so interesting is how much depth there is to something so simple. While its practical applications aren't as 
                        realized as 2-d CA models, 1-d elementary CA has become an entire field of study within CA due to the theoretical implications in math and computer science
                        that some rules exhibit. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Rule 90 creates a fractal structure called a <a id="edge-of-chaos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle" target="_blank">Sierpiński triangle</a>. Given 
                        a much higher resolution, this triangular pattern is infinitely repeated.  
                        Other rules like Rule 110 have been proven to be <a id="edge-of-chaos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank">Turing complete</a>. This essentially implies that,
                        given unlimited memory and time, any calculation or computer program can be simulated using this automaton provided that you give it the correct initial input.

                    </br>

                        Beyond the theory are some practical applications. Take for instance, Rule 184 or the "Traffic Rule". Rule 184 solves what CA scientists call
                        the "Majority Problem". The Majority Problem in CA is the problem of finding a 1-d CA rule that exhibits the behavior
                        of "majority voting", wherein given a configuration of a two-state CA model with i + j cells total, i of which are in the "0" state and j
                        of which are in the "1" state, a correct solution to the voting problem must eventually set all cells to "0" if i > j
                        and must eventually set all cells to "1" if i < j. The desired eventual state is unspecified if i = j.

                        The model above generates an initial row of 25% density, meaning that cars will randomly fill 25% of the empty spaces on the initial row.
                        From this initial preset, you can see that cars generally flow along the road and traffic jams clear up pretty quickly.

                        backed up. There are, however, rare instances where the Majority Problem will fail to pass and traffic clears up, but this isn't as 
                        frequent as a 50% initial density model.

                        the state of each cell's neighbor. At no point are cells given the total count of either states, and yet, it generally closes in on the

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        If you've heard of cellular automata in any context, you probably would have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" id="edge-of-chaos">Game of Life</a>. 
                        The Game of Life (although not technically a game, as there is no objective or user interaction) is a classic example of a 2-d CA system developed by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Much like what we've seen before in 1-d CA, 2-d CA is a time dependent system. However, instead of the next time sequence being represented by each row like in a 1-d CA model,
                        the next time sequence is just the next animation frame in the 2-d matrix of cells. 

                    </br>
                    </br>

                        The "neighbors" of each cell are also now going to be the 8 cells directly touching any cell. This configuration of potential neighbors for each cell is specific to 
                        the system being modeled, and the 8-neighbor configuration is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" id="edge-of-chaos">Moore neighborbood</a>.
                        
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        Whether a new cell is created or destroyed in the next frame is dependent on the number of neighbors surrounding a cell. 
                        There are four rules that dictate how cells are generated or destroyed: 
                            <li> Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation </li>
                            <li> Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation </li>
                            <li> Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation </li>
                            <li> Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction </li>
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        In the case of cells that are situated on the edge of the matrix, its neighbors off-grid are, instead, going to be cells
                        directly on its opposite edge. This endless, but finite, space is called a periodic boundary condition. The application of a 
                        periodic boundary condition is situational and dependent on the model.

                        The Game of Life might seem a bit hectic given its random initial condition, but given enough generations the system 
                        will reach an equilibrium and the once active cells will either form static or oscillating shapes.

                        stated that since 1985, the cost to fight these fires have increased 13 fold in 2018. In 1985, the cost to fight fires totaled

                        <li> Green cells represent the state of a burnable, organic matter; i.e. trees </li>
                        <li> Dark grey cells represent the state of incombustible, inorganic matter; i.e. rocks  </li>
                        <li> Red cells represent the state of an active fire </li>
                        <li> Black cells represent the state of incombustible, burnt organic matter; i.e. charcoal </li>
                    </p>

                    <p class="meat-paragraph">
                        Once started, any trees in direct contact with a fire has a 
                        12.5% chance of catching on fire per fire surrounding it. And so, any additional fires surrounding a tree will 
                        boost this probability of ignition by another 12.5%.

                        From these probabilities, A tree surrounded by 8 fires thus have a 100% chance of igniting, and 
                        at least two fire cells will propagate after the first jump in time.

                        a walker state in grey and an aggregate state in red. These walkers
                        are used to simulate the movement of people across a geography and have an equal chance of walking in any four directions

                        Brownian trees are the perfect example of the results found when a complex system successfully thrives on the edge of chaos. 
                        The creation of these trees are rooted in both chaos and order. 
                        Random walkers provide the entropy to a system that is balanced by the order of rules required to form an aggregate.

                        The presence of these Brownian trees are also found in complex systems found in nature, such as
                        the aggregation of oil embedded into sand by way of water pressure, formation of catalysts, and snowflakes.

                        Cellular Automata systems exist everywhere in life and when we recognize these systems around us, we 
                        can begin to conceptualize their inner workings. Through this understanding, we 
                        can then construct models in order to look for patterns in the system. With this knowledge, 
                        we're able to predict insightful data to formulate more sound, efficient solutions to some of 
                        the problems we face.
